Hi there! You've successfully made it to my portfolio.

Here I will showcase to you some of my work from my course on [Neural Data Science](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/).

These are some examples that demonstrate my coding abilities: 
- [Visualization of reaction times for a Flanker experiment](Visualization.md)
- [Single-unit data](Raster_Plot_Single-Unit_Data.md) 
- [Exploratory data analysis](T-test.md)
- [Panda Dataframes](Pandas_df.md)
- [Neuroimaging](Neuroimaging.md) 

Please reach out to me by [email](mailto:mr856487@dal.ca) if you have any further inquiries.
